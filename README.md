# ds_module_5 with data vis

In this module, I conducted comprehensive analysis and visualization of pharmaceutical datasets, providing key insights into clinical trial outcomes. Completed in Jupyter Notebook, pharmaceutical data is anaylyzed for the company Pymaceuticals. This company specializes in anti-cancer medications. Mutiple data visuals are also completed in this notebook to further clarify the analysis. Please open the pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb file located in the Pymaceuticals folder for the complete notebook.
